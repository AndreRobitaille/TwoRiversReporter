# Audience: Who Uses This Site

This document describes the residents of Two Rivers, WI — the people
this site is built for. Read this before making any UI, content, or
prioritization decisions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Demographics

- Primarily 35+, with roughly half the audience over 60.
- Many have deep, multi-generational ties to the city.
- Strong generational identity rooted in manufacturing heritage
  (Hamilton Industries, Eggers Industries).

## Disposition

- Skeptical of city leadership, both elected officials and appointed
  staff.
- Feel that decisions are often made before public input is genuinely
  considered.
- Pay close attention to who benefits from development and spending
  decisions.
- Value stability and preservation over growth and change.
- Have strong opinions about downtown character and lakefront use.
- Engage most actively when proposed changes affect their neighborhoods
  directly.

## How They Use This Site

- **Casual, infrequent visits.** They check in when something matters
  to them or when they hear about something — not daily.
- **Mobile-heavy.** Many access on phones. UI must work well at small
  screen sizes.
- **Scanners, not studiers.** They want the gist fast. Short
  descriptions, clear labels, obvious next steps.
- **They follow topics, not meetings.** A resident does not care about
  "Common Council Regular Meeting 2026-02-18" — they care about
  "Downtown Parking Changes."
- **Every topic name should be a door they can walk through.** An
  unlinked topic name is a dead end for someone who just got curious.
- **No accounts.** The public side has no login. They browse what is
  surfaced to them.
- **No search (yet).** Discovery is through what the site presents on
  the homepage and topic index.

## What They Need

- **Plain language.** No government jargon. Topic names at
  "neighborhood conversation" level — not hyper-specific (no
  addresses or applicant names).
- **Confidence that clicking leads somewhere useful.** Not a wall of
  bureaucratic text. Citation-backed summaries with separated
  fact/framing/sentiment serve this.
- **Time orientation.** They understand "this is happening soon" vs.
  "this already happened" vs. "this keeps coming back." They do not
  understand "lifecycle status."
- **Trustworthy sourcing.** They want to know where claims come from.
  The summaries and citations exist because this audience will not
  trust unsourced assertions.

## What They Do NOT Do

- Read raw PDFs unless specifically motivated.
- Navigate complex information hierarchies.
- Use technical filters or advanced search.
- Return to the site out of habit — only when something triggers
  interest.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Editorial Voice

This site is not a neutral government transcript service. It exists to
help residents understand what's happening and why it matters. The
editorial voice should reflect that mission.

### Tone

- **Skeptical of process and decisions, not of people.** Question what's
  being done and how decisions are made. Don't ascribe bad intent,
  malice, corruption, or unethical behavior to individuals.
- **Editorialize early.** Many residents check in casually and can't
  connect the dots across months of meetings. The summaries should do
  that work — surface patterns, note deferrals, flag when framing
  doesn't match outcomes.
- **"Means to an end" analysis is fair game.** Pointing out that a
  decision benefits developers at the expense of residents, or that
  safety framing is being used to justify changes with other effects, is
  useful analysis. Saying someone is acting in bad faith is not.

### Community Reputation Dynamics

Two Rivers is a tight social-capital community. Family names and
personal reputations carry real weight. Many residents — even those
who are privately critical — dislike public negativity about specific
individuals. They see it as airing dirty laundry.

This means:
- Criticize decisions and processes, not the people making them.
- Avoid language that reads as personal attacks, even if factually
  supported.
- When a pattern is concerning (repeated deferrals, process
  irregularities), describe the pattern and let the facts speak.
- The goal is informed residents, not public shaming.

### Terminology

- Use **"residents"** to refer to people who live in Two Rivers. The
  term **"locals"** specifically means people who were born there and
  carries identity weight — don't use it casually.

## Community Context (from Knowledgebase)

The following is the full text of the "Two Rivers Community Context —
Topic Extraction Guide" maintained in the application knowledgebase.
It describes what residents care about, what is routine, and local
governance nuances. This context applies to all topic extraction,
summarization, and UI decisions.

### Community Identity

Two Rivers, WI is a small post-industrial city on Lake Michigan with a
strong generational identity rooted in its manufacturing heritage
(notably Hamilton Industries and Eggers Industries). Many residents
have deep, multi-generational ties to the city and significant
nostalgia for its industrial past. The community values stability,
continuity, and the preservation of neighborhood character.

### What Residents Care About (High-Salience Topics)

The following types of civic issues are likely to be important to Two
Rivers residents. When these appear on agendas, they are strong
candidates for topic creation:

- Property tax increases, reassessments, or TIF district changes that
  affect household budgets
- Development or zoning changes that alter the physical character of
  neighborhoods, downtown, or the lakefront
- The tension between the city's manufacturing heritage and its
  transition toward a tourism-oriented economy — many residents did
  not choose and do not want this transition
- School district decisions, closures, or funding changes
- Infrastructure decay or major capital projects in established
  residential areas
- Changes to Main Street or Washington Street businesses and character
- Any item generating significant public comment volume — this is the
  strongest signal of resident concern
- Decisions where residents feel excluded from the process or believe
  leadership is not listening
- Narrow or divided votes on the council — these signal community
  disagreement
- Items where it matters who benefits from a decision (developer
  interests vs. resident interests)
- Historic preservation or demolition of landmarks
- Utility rates, water/sewer infrastructure, and service reliability

### What Is Routine (Low-Salience / Not Topic-Worthy)

The following types of items appear on agendas regularly but are
typically routine institutional business, not persistent civic
concerns. They should generally NOT become topics:

- Standard license renewals for existing businesses (liquor, operator,
  etc.) with no controversy
- Individual personnel actions (hiring, retirement) unless they affect
  a key leadership position
- Routine budget approvals or line-item transfers with no tax impact
- Procedural committee business (setting meeting dates, approving
  prior minutes)
- Proclamations, ceremonial recognitions, and awards
- Consent agenda items that are truly routine (not bundled
  controversial items)
- Standard vendor contract renewals at similar terms
- Routine report acceptances (monthly financial reports, department
  updates)

### Resident Disposition

Two Rivers residents tend to:

- Be skeptical of city leadership, both elected officials and
  appointed staff
- Feel that decisions are often made before public input is genuinely
  considered
- Pay close attention to who benefits from development and spending
  decisions
- Value stability and preservation over growth and change
- Have strong opinions about downtown character and lakefront use
- Engage most actively when proposed changes affect their
  neighborhoods directly

### Signals of Resident Importance

When evaluating whether a civic issue matters to residents, weight
these signals:

- Volume and intensity of public comment on an agenda item (strongest
  signal)
- Items that change the physical, economic, or social character of the
  community
- Divided or contentious votes (signal the community is not aligned)
- Issues where institutional framing ("economic development",
  "revitalization") may not match resident priorities
- Long-running disputes or concerns that residents keep raising
- Items where transparency or process complaints arise

### Local Governance Nuances

**Zoning and Land Use:**
Height and area exceptions are significant because the city uses them
to bypass fixing actual ordinances. These are worth tracking as a
pattern. Conditional use permits (CUPs) should always be surfaced.
Wisconsin state law requires notice and public comment for CUPs. They
are zoning variances and residents should be aware of them. Certified
survey maps, routine plat approvals, and standard subdivision items
are generally procedural unless tied to a controversial development.

**Licensing:**
Alcohol licenses (Class B, operator licenses, temporary beer licenses)
are routine and rarely important. They can generally be ignored unless
tied to a controversial new establishment or downtown character
dispute.

**Infrastructure:**
Lead lateral replacement is important because it tears up streets and
causes direct expense to residents. Always track. Sanitary lateral
work, water main replacement, and related street reconstruction affect
residents directly.

**Natural Resources and Lakefront:**
Anything involving Lake Michigan, the beach, the harbor, waterways, or
forests is usually important to residents. These are the main draw of
the area — both for historical identity and for driving tourism. City
leaders and business owners generally want more tourism; most residents
do not. Shoreline restoration, harbor maintenance, DNR grants for
natural areas, and forestry are high-salience topics.

**Public Safety:**
Most police and fire items are unimportant to residents unless they
involve significant expense (new vehicles, new buildings) or
significant enforcement actions/policy changes. Routine staffing,
training, and equipment purchases are low-salience.

**CDA and BIDC:**
The Community Development Authority (CDA) and Business Industrial
Development Committee (BIDC) are important institutions in theory but
have been largely ineffective for years. Track their activities to see
if they take meaningful action on housing, blight, or development —
but do not assume their agenda items are substantive just because the
bodies exist.

**Committee Roles and Cross-Body Movement:**
Topics routinely appear at multiple committees — this is normal
workflow and not noteworthy on its own. The only cross-body signal
that matters is when City Council sends something back down to a
subcommittee, which signals disagreement, unresolved issues, or that
Council was not satisfied with the committee recommendation.

**Committee on Aging:**
Primarily an update and input committee. Its purpose is to keep senior
residents informed and gather their input. Items discussed there
rarely involve substantive votes or binding decisions. Do not
overweight appearances at the Committee on Aging unless there is clear
evidence of real deliberation or a binding vote.
